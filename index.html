          <p>
              I was born and raised in the greater Cleveland Area by a mother who is a medical research assistant and a father who was a hardworking immigrant. From a young age I was instilled with the mindset to be thankful for anything I am given, because my dad was given nothing. Cherish what you do have, eat what is put in front of you. It is this mindset that has gotten me to where I am today. I view every opportunity as a blessing that I shan't turn down.

                  Coming from a household where Telemundo soccer was watched and spanish was spoken I was involved in soccer and various other sports from a young age. This instilled a competitive spirit in me that I still carry with me to this day. I am relentless when it comes to achieving my goals and do not give up easily. That competitive spirit shone when I entered High School and joined a Lego Robotics Team. I was now showcasing my mental prowess instead of my physical abilities but the competitive edge remained. We worked in RobotC which is a C-based programing language and instantly I was hooked on problem solving and debugging code. Being able to see a physical problem in the real world on a robot, go back into the code and scour for errors, and see the solution come to fruition right before your eyes was extremely rewarding. I enjoyed the sense of accomplishment when i can stand back and look at what I created. This love for problem solving has fueled my drive to become a Web Developer.
